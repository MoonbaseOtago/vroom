Physical Memory layout
----------------------

As a rule physical memory consists of coherent DRAM from address 0 to the end of the bottom half of physical
memory (56-bit addressing), and IO in the upper half of physical memory (or the system bootstrap for instruction fetches)

Instruction

A few notes about coding rules
------------------------------

- no latches
- we avoid passing arrays of wires to modules as some of the tools we're using can't yet handle that
  this results in occasional tackiness at module boundaries
- we use small C programs to generate random logic that if made by hand might be buggy or might
  be different between different numbers of modules/HARTs/CPUs etc - this verilog mostly lives in
  .inc files built by the Makefile, we often build a number of options, include them all and let
  generates choose which one we actually use
- one clock
- synchronous reset
- variables whose names begin with r_ are real flops and assigned with some variant of
  "always @(posedge clk) r_XXX <= c_XXX;"
- variables whose names begin with c_ are combinatorial and in almost cases are used to assign to a corresponding r_ register
- registers are only set with "always @(posedge clk)" and <= (some exceptions for explicitly instantiated cells)
- combinatorials are either:
  - declared as wire/input/output and set with 'assign', or
  - declared "reg" and only set with "always @(*)" - they must be defined in all if/else/cases of the
    always statement 
- we use X values for cases that can't/shouldn't happen both to give synthesis some leeway and also to trigger
    errors if they do actually happen (sadly verilator doesn't offer this as an option)

Building
--------

Everything is built with the one Makefile - if you have Icarus Verilog you can:

	make

or:

	make sv

This will build all the include files and then compile sv and svd - svd is just sv with pipeline trace enabled - they
read a single binary 'x.bin' that is loaded into simulated DRAM and boots from address 0. Both make .vcd files.

You can also use verilator for faster simulation:

	make svv

will build a verilator simulation that will load from x.bin (or any named file), it supports flags:

	-p        - turn on pipe trace
	-t        - start making .vcd files at clock 0
	-s N      - start making .vcd files at clock N
	-l N	  - simulate for N clocks
	
Verilog defines: PSYNTH is for building for the AWS fpga instances, in particular making RAMs for caches/etc. AWS_DEBUG
is for including Xilinx debug stuff - the ila_* and vio_* instances are debug instances, xxtrig 
is a signal passed around for triggering signal capture - these are not part of the CPU.
