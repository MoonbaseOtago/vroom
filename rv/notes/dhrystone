Dhrystone output over time - notes

Hardware: caches 32k/32k - cut down BTC - runs in linux user mode 50000 runs

Simulator: caches 64k/64k - larger BTC - runs in standalone machine mode 500 runs

- at this point the combined BTC predictor is broken, the bimodal
	predictor seems to be working well, the global history
	predictor is broken - the goal is a BTC hit rate in the
	high 90s

- predicted branches includes both conditional branches and indirect
	branches (mostly returns

- IPC does not include unconditional branches (which never get past
	the decode unit)

- hpmcounter4 is the number of committed branches, includes subroutine calls,
	returns, indirect jumps and conditional branches

- hpmcounter5 is the number that were predicted correctly

- cache size and main memory speed are largely moot here as dhrystone fits
	in both sized caches
